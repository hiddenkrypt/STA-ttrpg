    "priorHistory": "<h4>Early Life</h4>Llei'rala grew up with her parents, Kenra'sere and Seihwi, on the small Romulan Empire colony of Dier'Dalan. By all accounts she showed an early talent and enthusiasm for medicine. In 2374 the colony was attacked by the dominion. Llei'rala and her mother Kenra'sere escaped and began living on Romulus, but her parent Seiwhi died in the attack.  She completed her initial studies on Romulus at the Medical Academy of the Romulan Empire, and began post-graduate studies at the same until 2387. <br>Llei'rala was evacuated from Romulus before it's destruction from the romulan Supernova in 2387. Her mother died in the event. She spent two years volunteering as a medic to help her fellow refugees, before applying to starfleet with a goal of finishing her MD.</p><p><h4>Starfleet Medical Academy</h4>Llei'rala attended Starfleet Medical Academy in 2390 and earned her Doctorate of Medicine and Philosophy in 2395. However, at the time she was only interested in the medical program, and so was not a starfleet cadet; a rare but not unheard of situation.<br>Llei'rala was a rigorous student, and impressed professors with the knowledge she had already gained through prior study. This did not offer much of a shortcut in her studies, however, as her previous time at the Medical Academy of the Romulan Empire did not include nearly as much Xenobiology as required by Starfleet, and a large amount of her existing studies were not accepted.<h4>Starfleet service and Enlistment</h4>Llei'Rala's residency included a tour as a civilian consultant on a starfleet medical ship, cementing her association with the Federation. At the end of that tour, Llei'rala enrolled in Starfleet Academy as a cadet. She was considered a model student and graduated with honors.</p>",
